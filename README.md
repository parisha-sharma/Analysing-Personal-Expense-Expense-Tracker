## 📊 Overview

This project builds a **Personal Finance Analytics Dashboard** that transforms raw transaction data into meaningful insights using SQL analysis and interactive visualizations. The system stores expense records in a **MySQL database**, processes analytical queries using **Python and SQL**, and presents results through a **Streamlit-based dashboard** with multiple interactive charts.

The dataset contains **300+ transactions across 12 months** with details including category, payment method, cashback, and transaction value.

### 🎯 Project Goals

- Store and manage expense records using a structured MySQL database
- Write 30 analytical SQL queries to extract meaningful financial patterns
- Visualize spending trends, cashback performance, and payment behavior

## 📈 Dashboard Sections

<div align="center">

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Executive Summary** | Total spending, total cashback, average transaction value, monthly overview |
| **Core Analytics** | Category-wise spending, monthly trends, payment method distribution, cashback by category |
| **Advanced Insights** | High-value transaction ratio, payment mode efficiency, spending ranges, monthly cashback trends |

</div>

### Key Insights

- **Spending Patterns**: Certain categories consistently dominate overall spending across all months
- **Monthly Variance**: Spending fluctuates significantly month-to-month, revealing seasonal habits
- **Payment Efficiency**: Different payment methods vary meaningfully in cashback returns
- **Transaction Distribution**: A small percentage of transactions account for a disproportionately high share of total spend
- **Cashback Impact**: Cashback rewards can measurably influence optimal payment method choice
